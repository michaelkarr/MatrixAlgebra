The world of matrices and linear algebra can be interesting, but also very perplexing for students who are developing their abstract reasoning. MaTricks (MAY-tricks) is an iOS app written in Swift that is designed to help students learn about matrices and their operations. 

In MaTricks, users can input custom matrices and perform operations on them. Through a popup and text view interface, users follow the prompts to create and save matrices. The app allows for error checking for the dimensions in operations such as inverse or the determinant.
